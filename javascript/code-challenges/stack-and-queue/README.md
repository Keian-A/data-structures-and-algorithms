# Linked List Exercise 2

## Description
- Add a value to the end of a linked list, add a value after AND before a specific node in a linked list.

## Visual
- Dequeue:

![Dequeue](./Enqueue.jpg)
- Enqueue:

![Enqueue](./Dequeue.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
- For this challenge, I need to understand what `front` `rear` and `top` all truly mean within the aspects of Queues, and Stacks (respectively). Utilizing these three things, and changing the value and positions of them are vital to excelling at this challenge.

## Pseudo-code

```Text
First you need to set the front and head to null in the constructor function
Then you need to make method names for each function
For peek functions, just return the value at the position of the "front" of the list
For isEmpty functions, test if the value at the front position is null, return true if it is
```
