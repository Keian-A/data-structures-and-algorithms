This code is a function which takes in a k-ary tree and tests each node's value with the famous `Fizz Buzz` algorithm. This returns a new k-ary tree with the nodes that fit the `Fizz Buzz` algo, edited to their new values.

Fizz Buzz:
* This algorithm tests if a value:
  * Is divisible by 3, and if so, replaces the value with the string: "Fizz".
  * Is divisible by 5, and if so, replaces the value with the string: "Buzz".
  * Is divisible by 3 and 5, and if so, replaces the value with the string "FizzBuzz".
  * Is not divisible by either 3 or 5, and if so, changes the value into a string.
