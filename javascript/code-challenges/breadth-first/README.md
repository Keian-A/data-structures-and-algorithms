Breadth-first traversal prints all nodes at the same level before returning back up a level. For this example we start the root node at level 0, then incrementing one for each level under the root node. Breadth first search prints each 'level' before incrementing to the next 'level' finally ending once all nodes on the bottom level have been hit.
