JS Code creates a LinkedList, which is a (in the terms of this example) linear connection of `Node`s, contains following methods:

The `insert` method allows values to be added to the LL at the end.

The `traverse` method returns an array of all values within the LL starting from the list's head. 

The `includes` method returns true or false if the LL contains the value sent in the argument.

The `toString` method returns a concatenated string of all the values in the linkedlist separated by an arrow.
